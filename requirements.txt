# cchardet used to be a dependency of datapackage and version 2.1.6 requires users to install Visual C++
# NOTE: Commented on purpose. datapackage 1.15.0 does not require cchardet anymore. If we ever decide to
# use cchardet in addition to chardet, we should remember this constraint.
# cchardet!=2.1.6
# jsonschema is a requirement of datapackage (TODO: why do we only allow v2.6 here?)
